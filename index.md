<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I graduated with a master's degree from North Minzu University and currently work as a researcher at the Laboratory of Intelligent Processing for Image and Graphics under the State Ethnic Affairs Commission. I am working under the supervision of Professor Bai Jing. My research focuses on computer vision, including 3D model classification/retrieval, sketch-based 3D model retrieval, and zero-shot recognition. I am particularly interested in multi-view-based 3D model representation learning.
